# Smart-Fashion-Recommender-Application
A new innovative solution through which online shopping can be done based on your choice without the need to perform searches.
It is carried out by implementing a chatbot that helps users to make fashion choices by recommending outfits and styling ideas. 
Instead of searching for products in the search bar and navigating to individual products to find the required preferences, 
this project leverages the use of a chatbot.
to gather all required preferences and recommend products to the user. 
The solution is implemented in such a way so as to improve the interactivity between customers and application. 
For security concerns, this application uses a token to authenticate and authorize users securely. 
The token has an encoded user id and role. Based on the encoded information, access to the resources is restricted to specific users.
